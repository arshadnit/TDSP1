I scraped the data from GitHub's API using Python's requests library, targeting users in Singapore with over 100 followers, and collected their profile details along with their repository information.

I found that hireable users tend to share their email addresses more often than non-hireable users, which highlights the importance of visibility when job-seeking.

I recommend developers to ensure their profiles are complete, especially including email addresses, as it may enhance their networking opportunities and visibility to potential employers.
